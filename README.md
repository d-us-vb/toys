# Toys

Is a collection of my small projects that aren't super useful. Code sprints mostly.

## calculator.html

This is a basic calculator written in javascript and put in a single html file.  Written in <2 hours

## snake.py

This is a simple snake game written in python. It runs in any Unix terminal emulator, 
but you might need to change font settings in order for it to look right.
